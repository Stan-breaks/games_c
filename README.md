# Simple C Games

Welcome to my repository of simple games written in C! This is a fun project where I explore game development in C. Currently, we have the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Stay tuned for more games!

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a simple implementation of the classic game. The game is played in the console and the rules are the same as the traditional game.

### How to Play

1. Compile the C file using your preferred C compiler.
2. Run the compiled file.
3. The game will prompt you to enter your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
4. The computer will also make a choice.
5. The winner is decided based on the traditional rules of the game.

## Hangman

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Hangman. The game is played in the console. The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list and the player has to guess it one letter at a time.

### How to Play

1. Compile the C file using your preferred C compiler.
2. Run the compiled file.
3. The game will prompt you to guess a letter of the word.
4. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word.
5. If your guess is incorrect, the number of attempts will decrease.
6. The game continues until you’ve guessed the word or you’ve run out of attempts.

## Future Plans

I plan to add more games to this repository. If you have any suggestions or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
