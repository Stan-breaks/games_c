# Simple C Games

Welcome to my repository of simple games written in C! This is a fun project where I explore game development in C. Currently, we have the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Stay tuned for more games!

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a simple implementation of the classic game. The game is played in the console and the rules are the same as the traditional game.

### How to Play

1. Compile the C file using your preferred C compiler.
2. Run the compiled file.
3. The game will prompt you to enter your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
4. The computer will also make a choice.
5. The winner is decided based on the traditional rules of the game.

## Future Plans

I plan to add more games to this repository. If you have any suggestions or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
